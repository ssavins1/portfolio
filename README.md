# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I'm Sam Avins â€” a software engineer with a passion for systems design, graphics programming, and game development. This profile contains limited public content, but Iâ€™m actively developing a full-featured 2D game framework that Iâ€™d love to share with the right audience.

## ðŸŽ® Featured Project (Private)

### ðŸ”§ **Grave** â€” A Custom 2D Java Game Framework

Grave is a handcrafted game development framework built using LWJGL. It features:

- Entity-Component System (ECS) architecture
- Legacy OpenGL rendering backends with planned support for Modern GL and Vulkan
- Chunked tile map rendering with framebuffer scaling
- Multiplayer networking via custom serialization
- Debug tooling including a real-time stack profiler

This project is still under active development and not publicly available â€” but I'm happy to provide access upon request.
